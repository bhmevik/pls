.) bootstrap .632 estimator: Ron: April 2005: pls_1.1-0
   Alternative for CV

.) ncomp should not always start at 1: ? : ? : ?
   In validation, I sometimes know that I need at least 4-5
   components; I am not interested in checking the performance of
   PLS/PCR with only 1 or 2 components. This only costs time...

.) mvr(X, Y, ncomp): ? : ? : ?
   For people not used to formula interfaces...

.) coefplot: ? : ? : ?
   Add support for labeling the x ticks with variable names

.) validatoinplot: ? : ? : ?
   Adde legends (must be done so it doesn't break with R < 2.1.0

.) summary.mvr: ? : ? : ?
   include validated R2, and/or allow to select which statistics.


Wishlist/ideas/thoughts:
================
.) biplot.default:
   Check scaling of biplot.default (maybe: suggest changes to xlabs/ylabs).
   Also check FIXMEs in code.

.) mvr/mvrCv: check for ncomp <= n - max seg.len - 1.  mvr(..., CV=TRUE)
  doesn't work (pcr) or gives nonsense results (plsr) without specifying
  ncomp.  Should we fix that (and how)?

.) When MSEP/RMSEP calculates se: add +/- se to plot.mvrVal

.) Properly crossvalidate MSEP0?  (Now it is always LOOCV.)

.) Properly crossvalidate R2 for 0 comps?

.) Check the handling of NAs in the different functions

.) Make loadings generic

.) a package-options mechanism for choosing default methods, scalings and
   estimates?
